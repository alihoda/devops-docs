# MongoDB Replication

Difference between **replication** and **sharding**:

- Replication copies all of the primary's data to each secondary server.
- Sharding copies pieces of the data (or *shards*) to a set of replica set.

> In *shard cluster* every shards has a replication to have the same high availability.
